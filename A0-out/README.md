Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

Using Javadoc really helped with how the interfaces should look. It was difficult at first to think about how I should begin this assignment but being able to see in class and on Javadoc how it should look I was able to piece things together from there. I'm excited to learn more and implement new ways of thinking.
